# instead of its own virtual network adapters, set the hostNetwork property to true. In doing so,
# the pod gets to use the node's network interfaces instead of its own; this means the pod doesn't
# get its own IP address, and if it runs a process that binds to a port, the process will be bound
# to the node's port. (It allows a pod to listen to all network traffic for all pods on the node
