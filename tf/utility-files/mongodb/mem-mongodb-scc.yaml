# Both Pod Security Policy (PSP) and Security Context Constraints (SCC) are cluster-level (non-   #
# namespaced) resources and allows administrator to control the security aspects of pods in       #
# Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters, respectively.                                                #
###################################################################################################
# WARNING: Once privileges are given to a Security Context Constraint (SCC) and the SCC is granted
#          to a project Service Account (for example, via a role binding), any deployer in the
#          project can take advantage of those privileges.
# Notes:
# (1) By default, in OpenShift, all pods and containers will use the Restricted SCC.
# (2) Similar to the way that RBAC resources control user access, administrators can use SCCs to
#     control permissions for pods. These permissions include actions that a pod can perform and
#     what resources it can access. Administrators can use SCCs to define a set of conditions that
#     a pod must run with to be accepted into the system.
#
# To get a current list of SCCs:
# $ oc get scc
#
# To create an SCC by passing in a file:
# $ oc apply -f <scc-file>.yaml
#
# To verify that the SCC was created:
# $ oc get scc <scc_name>
#
# To examine a specific SCC; e.g., the restricted SCC:
# $ oc describe scc restricted
#
# To delete an SCC:
# $ oc delete scc <scc_name>
#
# To link a custom SCC to a custom service account:
# $ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user <scc-name> <service-account-name>

# Determine if any container in a pod can enable privileged mode. By default a container is not
# allowed to access any devices on the host, but a "privileged" container is given access to all
# devices on the host. This allows the container nearly all the same access as processes running on
# the host. This is useful for containers that want to use Linux capabilities like manipulating the
# network stack and accessing devices.
allowPrivilegedContainer: false
# Gate whether or not a user is allowed to set the security context of a container to

# its parent.

allowHostPorts: false

# To prevent processes from writing to the container's filesystem (processes can only write to
